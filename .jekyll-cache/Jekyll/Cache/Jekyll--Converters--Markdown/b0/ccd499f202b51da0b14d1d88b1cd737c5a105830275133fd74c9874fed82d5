<p>The 25th conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology was held at <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017">Prague, Czech Republic</a> in 2017. I had the pleasure of presenting a talk and poster at ISMB. Here is the poster that I presented.</p>

<p>Computational analysis of molecular interaction networks has become pervasive in systems biology. Despite the existence of several software systems and interfaces to analyze and view networks, interdisci- plinary research teams in network biology face several challenges in sharing, exploring, and interpreting computed networks in their collaborations.
GRAPHSPACE is a web-based system that provides a rich set of user-friendly features designed to stim- ulate and enhance network-based collaboration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can upload richly-annotated networks, irrespective of the algorithms or software used to gener- ate them. GRAPHSPACE networks follow the JSON format supported by Cytoscape.js [1]. Users of Cytoscape [3] can export their networks and upload them directly into GRAPHSPACE.</li>
  <li>Users can create private groups, invite other users to join groups, and share networks with groups.</li>
  <li>A user may search for networks with a specific property or that contain a specific node or collection
of nodes.</li>
  <li>A powerful layout editor allows users to efficiently modify node positions, edit node and edge styles,
save new layouts, and share them with other users.</li>
  <li>Researchers may make networks public and provide a persistent URL in a publication, enabling other
researchers to explore these networks.</li>
  <li>A comprehensive RESTFul API streamlines programmatic access to GRAPHSPACE features.</li>
  <li>A Python module called graphspace python allows a user to rapidly construct a graph, set visual
styles of nodes and edges, and then upload the graph, all within tens of lines of code. It is very easy
to integrate this script into a userâ€™s software pipeline.
Currently, GraphSpace supports more than 300 users who have stored more than 21,000 graphs (most of
them private) containing a total of over 1.4 million nodes and 3.8 million edges. Conceptually, GRAPHSPACE serves as a bridge between visualization and analysis of individual networks supported by systems such as Cytoscape [3] and the network indexing capabilities of NDex [2]. We anticipate that GRAPHSPACE will find wide use in network biology projects and will assist in accelerating all aspects of collaborations among computational biologists and experimentalists, including preliminary investigations, manuscript develop- ment, and dissemination of research.</li>
