I"ø<p>Networks have become ubiquitous in systems biology and visualization is a crucial component in their analysis. In this blog post I am going explore the power of simulated annealing algorithm in laying out PPINs. The algorithm is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)">annealing in metallurgy</a>, a technique that involves heating a material above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature, and then cooling. The Simulated
Annealing (SA) algorithm represents the space of the visualization problem as a set of layouts (states) each one with associated energy, and it tries to find the layout (state) with minimum energy (i.e. below a threshold) that represents a potential network layout.</p>
