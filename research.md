## [GraphSpace](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx382/3867143/GraphSpace-stimulating-interdisciplinary)

Networks have become ubiquitous in systems biology. Visualization is a crucial component in their analysis. However, collaborations within research teams in network biology are hampered by software systems that are either specific to a computational algorithm, create visualizations that are not biologically meaningful, or have limited features for sharing networks and visualizations. We present GraphSpace, a web-based platform that fosters team science by allowing collaborating research groups to easily store, interact with, layout and share networks

**Availability and implementation**: Anyone can upload and share networks at [http://graphspace.org](http://graphspace.org). In addition, the GraphSpace code is available at [http://github.com/Murali-group/graphspace](http://github.com/Murali-group/graphspace) if a user wants to run his or her own server.

## XTalkDB: A Database of Signaling Pathway Crosstalk

Analysis of signaling pathways and their crosstalk is a cornerstone of systems biology. Thousands of papers have been published on these topics. Surprisingly, there is no database that carefully and explicitly documents crosstalk between specific pairs of signaling pathways. We have developed XTALKDB ([http://www.xtalkdb.org](http://www.xtalkdb.org)) to fill this very important gap. XTALKDB contains curated information for 650 pairs of pathways from over 1600 publications. In addition, the database reports the molecular components (e.g. proteins, hormones, microRNAs) that mediate crosstalk between a pair of pathways and the species and tissue in which the crosstalk was observed. The XTALKDB website provides an easy-to-use interface for scientists to browse crosstalk information by querying one or more pathways or molecules of interest.
